# sidestream-coding-challange

This challange has been an odd one for me because i completed it with one hand. (got a left elbow fracture)
Also, i got the challange monday but i only saw it on wednesday night so i didnt have time to do everything and make it better.
This has been a great challange, ive never used vue before or tailwind css but it was so much fun and i learned a lot so Thank you.

I am not sure if i was supposed to display the number of intersecting errors in the frontend, but if you go to /get_list_intersection_counts you will see that it works.
