# sidestream-coding-challange
This challange has been an odd one for me because i completed it with one hand. (got a left elbow fracture)
Also, i got the challange monday but i only saw it on wednesday night so i didnt have time to do everything and make it better.
This has been a great challange, ive never used vue before or tailwind css but it was so much fun and i learned a lot so Thank you.
